I borrowed the bayer.c from the libdc1394 project [1], it is licensed under LGPL.

This is an implementation of the idea I stumbled upon on ImageMagick's mailing list while searching for a bayer grid converter. The thread can be found at [2].The interpolation alogrithms used are described at [3].


Installation
------------

    make
    cp bayer2rgb /usr/bin/


Running
-------

    usage: ./bayer2rgb
       --input,-i     input file
       --output,-o    output file
       --width,-w     image width (pixels)
       --height,-v    image height (pixels)
       --bpp,-b       bits per pixel
       --first,-f     first pixel color: RGGB, GBRG, GRBG, BGGR
       --method,-m    interpolation method: NEAREST, SIMPLE, BILINEAR, HQLINEAR, DOWNSAMPLE, EDGESENSE, VNG, AHD
       --help,-h      this helpful message.

ImageMagick Integration
-----------------------

A delegates.xml file is included, however, I haven't gotten it to work. The delegate shows up in `convert -list delegate` but fails to run. From some initial research it seems that it may require a newer version of ImageMagick than I have installed, YMMV.

Questions: 
    1. how can I make the delegate.xml work
    2. How would I pass custom parameters (interpolation method and more importantly first color).
